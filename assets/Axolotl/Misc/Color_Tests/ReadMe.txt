Hello curious game developer! This folder has some color
designs that I scrapped because I felt they were too unrealistic.
It also includes head fin sprites.
You of course can use these sprites as you would the main sprites, I just
tucked them away in this folder so the main folder didn't look so messy with
half-completed ideas and templates.

Also! If you use Godot for game dev, you can adjust the hue of the Creme 
colored Axolotl sprites in this folder to be just about any light color
you'd like.

If you have any questions or requests, please reach out to me. I work full
time, so it may take a few days to get back to you, but I'll get around to 
it as soon as I have time. 

Cheers!
